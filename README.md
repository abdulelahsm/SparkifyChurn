## predicting_churn_with_spark

Here I attempt to learn to manipulate large and realistic datasets with Spark to engineer relevant features for predicting churn. 

I used Spark MLlib to build machine learning models with large datasets, far beyond what could be done with non-distributed technologies like scikit-learn.  

Predicting churn rates is a challenging and common problem that data scientists and analysts regularly encounter in any customer-facing business. Additionally, the ability to efficiently manipulate large datasets with Spark is one of the highest-demand skills in the field of data.
